# Kotlin Star Pattern Challenge

## Overview

In this challenge, you are required to create various star patterns using **Kotlin** within an **Android Studio** project. The goal is to generate patterns programmatically and display them in the app's UI.

## Instructions

You will be tasked with creating the following star patterns based on the image provided:

1. **Piramida bintang** (Star Pyramid)
2. **Piramida terbalik bintang** (Inverted Star Pyramid)
3. **Layang-layang bintang** (Kite/Diamond Star Pattern)
4. **X bintang** (X-shaped Star Pattern)
5. **Piramida hollow bintang** (Hollow Star Pyramid)

## Steps to Complete

1. **Create a New Android Studio Project**:

   - Set up a new project using Kotlin as the primary programming language.
   - Use `LinearLayout` or `ConstraintLayout` as the container to hold the star patterns.

2. **Design the Layout**:

   - Use `TextView` components to display each pattern.
   - Make sure the layout allows scrolling if the content exceeds the screen height (use `ScrollView`).

3. **Generate Star Patterns Programmatically**:

   - Write Kotlin functions to generate the star patterns as strings.
   - For each pattern, utilize loops and conditional logic to print stars and spaces accordingly.

4. **Display the Patterns in the UI**:

   - Set the generated star patterns as text in `TextView` components in your Android layout.

5. **Ensure the Patterns Match the Following**:

   - **Star Pyramid**: A right-side up pyramid made of stars.
   - **Inverted Star Pyramid**: An upside-down pyramid made of stars.
   - **Kite/Diamond Pattern**: A combination of a pyramid and an inverted pyramid to form a diamond shape.
   - **X Pattern**: Two diagonal lines of stars forming an "X".
   - **Hollow Star Pyramid**: A hollow pyramid with stars only on the edges.

6. **Test and Debug**:
   - Run the project to ensure the patterns are correctly displayed and the app works smoothly.
   - Adjust spacing and alignment if necessary for a clean appearance.

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- Kotlin programming language

## Deliverables

- Android Studio project with correctly generated star patterns.
- Patterns should be displayed in the app UI and match the provided image.
